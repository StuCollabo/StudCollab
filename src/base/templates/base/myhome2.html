<p>Mathieu MATONGO is a young student in CS major. While receiving his group's work, 
he noticed people are use to make a group with people whose homes are near to others.
So Mathieu thought about a platform where Student and maybe other type of people
can collaborate, sending some documents or assigning tasks or even work together in real-time on the same document.
